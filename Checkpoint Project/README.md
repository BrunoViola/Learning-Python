# ðŸŽ® Terminal Adventure 
<p>CodÃ©dex proposed a project in which I was tasked with building a simple adventure game played directly in the terminal,
using the knowledge I had gained up to this point (<strong>Python Basics</strong>). In this game, the player is challenged to battle creatures 
in order to protect the village.</p>
